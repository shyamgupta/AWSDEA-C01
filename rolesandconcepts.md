# Foundations: Roles and Concepts
## Data Engineer
A data engineer transforms raw data into valuable insights, develops and maintains data architectures, Extract-Transform-Load pipelines that data analysts, data scientists, and other data consumers can use to effectively access and analyze data.
Below are the key functions of a data engineer:
1. **Build and Manage Data Infrastructure and Platforms**: Includes setting up databases, data lakes, and data warehouses on AWS services like S3, AWS Glue, Amazon Redshift, etc. 
2. **Ingest data from various sources**: Use tools like AWS Glue jobs or AWS Lambda functions to ingest data from databases, applications, files, and streaming devices into the centralized data platforms. 
3. **Prepare the ingested data for analytics**: Use AWS Glue, Apache Spark, or Amazon EMR  etc to prepare data by cleaning, transforming, and enriching it.
4. **Catalog and document curated datasets**: Use AWS Glue crawlers to determine the format and schema, group data into tables, and write metadata to the AWS Glue Data Catalog. Use metadata tagging in Data Catalog for data governance and discoverability
5. **Automate regular data workflows and pipelines**: Simplify and accelerate data processing using services like AWS Glue workflows, AWS Lambda, or AWS Step Functions.
6. **Ensure data quality, security, and compliance**: Create access controls, establish authorization policies, and build monitoring processes. Use Amazon DataZone or AWS Lake Formation to manage and govern access to data using fine-grained controls. These controls help ensure access with the right level of privileges and context.
